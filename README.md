# typed-lang

A toy language

- Simple type system (strong + nominal)
  - Rust-like structs
  - Simple trait system
- Syntax similar to Python (minimalistic, indentation-sensitive)
- Transpiles to JavaScript (ES6+, compatible with Node.js and modern browsers)

There are also plans to support WASM as a primary target for compilation (using LLVM and Wasmer runtime).
